# Hostbase
A bash script for advanced rogue AP attack  

The script is able to:
Disconnect quickly the target station from the target network
Create heavy interference and replace the target AP by your fake (work only again windows system)
Once you entered the data of target network, the script is autonomous and can work alone, just go take a cup of tea :)

French project but also open as other.
