# Hostbase
A bash script for advanced rogue AP attack  

The script is able to:
Disconnect quickly the target station from the target network,
Create encrypted fake WPA AP,
Create heavy interference and replace the target AP by your fake (work only again windows system),
Ask to push te WPS button instead of ask the key which is very suspicious... 
Once you entered the data of target network, the script is autonomous and can work alone, just go take a cup of tea :)
French most popular router pages are included

Tool used are hostapd and airbase-ng for a final result of hostbase.

French project but also open as other to make this more fun.
